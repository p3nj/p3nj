A self-taught full-stack engineer with 5+ years of working experience, been in positions on UI/UX, PG, RD, QA, PM aaand DevOps.

Experienced with **C#, Python, Golang, TypeScript, Docker, K8s, Azure aaand AWS**
  
I don't use GitHub as a place to share my code, instead using it to follow up on open-source projects.

I decided to resign my job after burnout and start following what I really love. Hence, you probably will see me around more often.
