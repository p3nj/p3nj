A self-taught full-stack engineer with 5+ years of working experience, having worked in positions on UI/UX, PG, RD, QA, PM, and DevOps.

Experienced with **C, C#, Python, Golang, TypeScript, Rust, Docker, K8s, Azure aaand AWS**
  
I don't use GitHub to share my code; instead, I use it to follow up on open-source projects.

After burnout, I decided to resign from my job and start following what I really love. Hence, you will probably see me around more often.
